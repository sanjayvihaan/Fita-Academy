JavaScript Loops:

Loops can be complicated, there are for loops, while loops, and do...while loops.

1. for Loop
We will be creating a few mini-projects that will loop through a set of numbers.

syntax:

    for (component1, component2, component3) {
        //code or statements
    }

    var num = 1;
    for (num == 1; num <= 10; num++){
        console.log(`Number: ${num}`);
    }
