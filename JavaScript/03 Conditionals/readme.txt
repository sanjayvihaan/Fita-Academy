JavaScript Conditionals
    Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.


We have three types of Conditionals:
    1. If Statement: Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
        example: 
        if(5 == 5){
            console.log("This is number 5 only");
        }
    2. If-else if Statement
    3. If-else if-else Statement
