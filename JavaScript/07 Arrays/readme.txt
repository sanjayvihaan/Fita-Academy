JavaScript Array;

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

var cars = ['BMW', 'TATA', 'Volvo', 'Honda', 'Hyundia']

var cars = 'BMW'

const programLang = [];

programLang[0] = "JavaScript";
programLang[1] = 'Python';

Reminder: Most programming languages start from 0, not 1, so when we access the cars variable, we grab the value from the 1st position.

1. Arrays are extremely important when storing multiple values within a variable.
2. This way we don't have to write 100 variables and instead can store them all in a single variable, this is an array.
3. There are multiple ways to write an array, but this one is simplest and most basic version is the example above.
