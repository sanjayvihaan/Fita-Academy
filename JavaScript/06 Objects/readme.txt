JavaScript Objects:
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

Example:

    var car = {
        Model: 2020,
        Color: 'white',
        Ownership: 'First Owner'
    }


property = 
    Model , Color, Ownership
Stored value =
    2020, 'white', 'First Owner'
