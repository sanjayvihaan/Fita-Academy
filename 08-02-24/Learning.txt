CSS - Cascading Styling Sheet

We use this for style an HTML document


/* ------------ */

-> Inline css:
<p style="color:white">This is a paragraph</p>

Any tag inside with the style attribute is known as Inline CSS

-> Internal CSS:

In a html document, we have the <head></head> - inside this header tag we need to create
style inside the style we can call the tag use the tag name, classes, or ID

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

-> External CSS:

For the external css - we need to create a new styling sheet with .css extention, and need
to connect inside the html document inside in the head tag.
